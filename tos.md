# Terms of Service

These Terms of Service (the "Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and OctaSpace ("we," "us," or "our") and govern your use of the VPN services, applications, software, websites, or other services provided by us (the "Services").

## 1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By using our VPN, you fully accept these Terms, including all policies and guidelines incorporated by reference. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Terms and agree to be bound by them. If you do not accept the Terms, you must immediately stop using the Services.

Your access to and use of the Service is conditional upon your acceptance and compliance with these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of these Terms and Conditions, you may not access the Service.

You represent that you are over the age of 18. OctaSpace does not permit those under 18 to use the Service.

## 2. THE SERVICE

The VPN service protects personal information through encryption using various supported protocols, and masks user metadata by hiding the user's IP address and replacing it with the IP address of the selected node. OctaSpace VPN facilitates the connectivity between the client and node owner and supports multiple protocols based on user preference.

The service provided by node owners is done in good faith. However, you are responsible for ensuring that your behavior while using the service will not place the node owner in a compromising position by conducting any illegal activity.

## 3. PAYMENT

Payment for services is conducted in $OCTA coins and is charged on a pay-as-you-go basis per GB. Prior to using the service, you must ensure sufficient funds are available in your cube account. During the session, your funds from the Cube account will be periodically deducted based on the amount of data used and the price determined by the selected node. OctaSpace provisions the charging from your cube account to the node owner for services rendered. All transactions are logged on the blockchain, and we do not process payments in any other currency.

## 4. PRIVACY

We prioritize your privacy and anonymity. OctaSpace does not store any activity logs or metadata. We do not hold any personal information about you, and we do not log any of your session activity. To access and use the Services, you will need to bind your cube wallet address, ensuring you have the required funds. The account used for this purpose may vary, and you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your data. We are not liable for any loss resulting from unauthorized use of your data.


## 5. EQUIPMENT

You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all hardware, software, and other equipment needed to access and use the Services. You shall be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any necessary licenses, equipment, and software required to access and/or use the resources or services that require prior authorization.

## 6. USAGE POLICY AND PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

OctaSpace does not condone illegal activities. You shall not use the Services for any unlawful or prohibited purpose, including violating the rights of others or encouraging criminal offenses. Prohibited activities include accessing or sharing illegal content, harassing others based on gender, religion, ethnicity, etc., sending spam, unauthorized access to computing devices, infringing intellectual property rights, promoting illegal activities, and providing instructional information for illegal activities.

You agree that Node owners providing the Services are doing so in good faith and shall not be held responsible or liable for any user's behavior while using the Service. You are responsible for ensuring that your behavior while using the Service will not place the Node owner in an uncompromising position by conducting any illegal activity.

## 7. DISCLAIMERS

OctaSpace reserves the right to modify the Service, and we will attempt to prevent interruptions and defects. However, the Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, and we do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or the accuracy of the Service or any material provided. You are solely responsible for your use of the Service.

## 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

By using the Service, you agree that it is at your sole risk. OctaSpace and its affiliates, employees, agents, and licensors do not warrant uninterrupted or error-free Service and disclaim all warranties, either express or implied. We shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of the Service, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.

Node owners providing the Services shall also be entitled to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of their provision of the Services, except for claims arising directly from the user's misuse or illegal activities while using the Services.

## 9. FORCE MAJEURE

Neither party shall be responsible for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, war, riot, embargoes, civil or military authorities' acts, fires, floods, accidents, equipment and/or software failures, and telecommunication failures.

## 10. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and our affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents harmless from all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising from your use of the Services.

Node owners providing the Services shall also be entitled to indemnification and protection from claims and liabilities arising out of their participation in providing the Services. Users of the Services shall hold Node owners harmless and indemnify them against any claims, losses, or damages resulting from the user's use of the Services.

## 11. MISCELLANEOUS

The Services are intended for use only in compliance with applicable laws. You agree to comply with all applicable export laws and restrictions. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all previous agreements. No waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. If any provision in the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in force. These Terms and our rights may be assigned by us or our affiliates to third parties at our sole discretion. You may not delegate, sublicense, or assign your rights under these Terms.

## 12. CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE

We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

We encourage all users to abide by the Usage Policy and Prohibited Activities outlined in these Terms to ensure the protection and reputation of Node owners and the integrity of our Services.
